# Invoice OCR Automation using Python & UiPath

This project demonstrates an intelligent automation solution that extracts key information from invoice images using OCR and automates execution using UiPath RPA.

## 🔍 Project Overview
The system processes invoice images, extracts important fields such as invoice number, date, vendor name, and total amount, and generates structured JSON output automatically.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Invoice images are provided as input
2. A Python OCR pipeline preprocesses the image and extracts text
3. Relevant invoice fields are identified and cleaned
4. Output is generated in JSON format
5. UiPath orchestrates the automation by triggering the Python script

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OCR (Tesseract/EasyOCR)
- OpenCV
- JSON
- UiPath RPA
- PowerShell

## 📂 Output
The final output is a structured JSON file containing extracted invoice details.
